Description: Simple Wayland shell
 Phosh is a simple shell for Wayland compositors speaking the
 layer-surface protocol. It currently supports
 .
 * enough of org.gnome.Mutter.DisplayConfig to make gnome-settings-daemon happy
 * the gcr system-prompter interface
 .
 If you're not working on a Wayland compositor then this package
 is likely not very useful for you.
