Description: Pure Wayland shell for mobile devices
 Phosh is a simple shell for Wayland compositors speaking the layer-surface
 protocol. It currently supports
 .
  * a lockscreen
  * brightness control and nighlight
  * the gcr system-prompter interface
  * enough of org.gnome.Mutter.DisplayConfig to make gnome-settings-daemon happy
  * a homebutton that toggles a simple favorites menu
  * status icons for battary and wwan
 .
 If you're not working on a Wayland compositor then this package is likely not
 very useful for you.
